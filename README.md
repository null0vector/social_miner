# SocialMiner

SocialMiner is a Ruby gem that provides a simple interface to fetch public data from Instagram, including user profiles, posts, and comments.

# Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'social_miner'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

# Usage
Fetch user profile info:

```ruby
result = SocialMiner::Instagram.profile_info(username: "instagram")
# Result contains:
# {
#   social_id: "123456789",
#   username: "instagram_username",
#   description: "User bio",
#   first_name: "John",
#   last_name: "Doe",
#   avatar_url: "https://...",
#   followers: 1000,
#   following: 500
# }
```

To fetch a user's posts:

```ruby
# User ID can be obtained from the profile info (social_id field)
result = SocialMiner::Instagram.profile_posts(user_id: "user_id")

# Result contains:
# {
#   cursor: "next_page_token",
#   records: [
#     {
#       social_id: "post123",
#       image_url: "https://...",
#       shortcode: "ABC123",
#       location_name: "New York",
#       description: "Post caption",
#       published_at: 2024-03-20 12:00:00
#     }
#   ],
#   count: 100
# }

# To fetch next page:
next_page = SocialMiner::Instagram.profile_posts(user_id: "user_id", cursor: result[:cursor])
```

To fetch comments on a specific post:

```ruby
result = SocialMiner::Instagram.post_comments(post_shortcode: "ABC123")

# Result contains:
# {
#   cursor: "next_page_token",
#   records: [
#     {
#       social_id: "comment123",
#       body: "Great post!",
#       published_at: 2024-03-20 12:00:00
#     }
#   ],
#   count: 1
# }

# To fetch next page of comments:
next_page = SocialMiner::Instagram.post_comments(post_shortcode: "ABC123", cursor: result[:cursor])
```

# Custom Headers

You can pass custom headers to the requests by passing a hash to the `request_headers` option:

```ruby
SocialMiner::Instagram.profile_info({ "Custom-Header" => "Header-Value" }, username: "instagram")
```

# Custom Mapper

You can use a custom mapper to transform the data into a custom structure.

```ruby
module CustomMapper
  def map(attrs)
    { id: attrs['id'] }
  end

  module_function :map
end
```

Use your custom mapper:

```ruby
SocialMiner::Instagram.profile_info(username: "instagram") do |profile_attrs|
  CustomMapper.map(profile_attrs)
end
```

# Fetch all posts / comments

```ruby
class BackgroundJob
  def perform(user_id, cursor: nil)
    result = SocialMiner::Instagram.profile_posts(user_id: user_id, cursor: cursor)

    # Bulk import to DB
    Post.import(result[:records])

    perform_async(user_id, result[:cursor]) unless result[:cursor].nil?
  end
end
```
